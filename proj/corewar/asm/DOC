asm convert ASM source code into destination opcode.

An ASM instruction can be:
	[:label]	instruction [param1,param2,...]
Or:
	[:label]
				instruction [param1,param2,...]

The conresponding opcode is:
	instruction_opcode,[OCP],[param_values]

OCP is an octet who define the types of param
param is encoded switch instruction

Param can be one of the three following type:
	registre (r)
	indirect N
	direct %(N or :label)

registre is encoded as one byte taking the value of the registre number
indirect is encoded as two byte taking the value N
direct is encoded as two or four byte (switch instruction) taking the value N or the offset between current instruction and the labeled one



valide lines are:

.cmd "literal"
word:
word: word word, %:word, word
word word, %:word, word
